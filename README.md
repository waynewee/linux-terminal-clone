Task Assigned: BF + EF1

## System Requirements
- OS: Windows 10
- Java: JDK 11

## Testing Instructions
We included Maven support into our project. IntelliJ automatically reorganized the project structure. Thus, the test
folder has been moved. Test cases can be found in src/test/java.

**Note:** You may need to mark the folders as Sources Root and Tests Sources Root again. In that case,
mark src/main/java as Sources Root folder and src/test/java as Tests Sources Root. If build failed due to test cases in
the unimpl folder, mark it as excluded.

### Running tests
To run all the test cases, right click on src/test/java folder, and select "Run 'All Tests'".
